# function_wordle_game

This is a mathy puzzle taking lots of inspiration from Wordle, where the objective of the game is to guess a function in as few attempts as possible. Before each guess, the user may prompt for the function's value at a given input, which are both limited to the natural numbers for the sake of simplicity.

The implementation of this game will initially be written in Java.
